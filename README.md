# Vanilla-JavaScript
>[!TIP]
>Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain JavaScript without relying on any libraries, frameworks, or plugins like React, Angular, or jQuery. Itâ€™s the pure, unmodified version of JavaScript that runs directly in the browser.

### Key Features of Vanilla JavaScript:
- Native JavaScript: All functionality is implemented using the core language features provided by JavaScript.
- Lightweight: No extra files or dependencies are included, making it lightweight and efficient.
- Browser Compatibility: Since it doesn't rely on third-party tools, Vanilla JavaScript can be used to create solutions that work across multiple browsers.
- Direct DOM Manipulation: Tasks such as selecting elements, handling events, or modifying the DOM are done manually using native JavaScript APIs like document.querySelector(), addEventListener(), and appendChild().

### Why Use Vanilla JavaScript?
- Performance: It's faster since there's no overhead from libraries or frameworks.
- Learning Fundamentals: It helps developers understand the core concepts of JavaScript before diving into frameworks.
- Full Control: Developers have complete control over their code without constraints imposed by frameworks.
- Reduced Complexity: For simple tasks or small projects, Vanilla JavaScript avoids unnecessary complexity.

Example:
Here's a simple example of Vanilla JavaScript to change the text of an element:
```javascript
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    document.getElementById('myText').textContent = 'Hello, Vanilla JavaScript!';
});
```
In contrast, a library like jQuery might simplify the above code but adds extra dependencies. Using Vanilla JavaScript keeps your application lightweight and more self-contained.
